Throughout 2021 I have been tracking my use of plastic using [MyPlasticDiary](https://www.myplasticdiary.co.uk/). I was curious to see how much plastic I was using and whether I could find ways to reduce my plastic waste.

Here, I analyse my tracking data. Watch my blog for upcoming posts about it.
