Throughout 2021 I have been tracking my use of plastic using [MyPlasticDiary](https://www.myplasticdiary.co.uk/). I was curious to see how much plastic I was using and whether I could find ways to reduce my plastic waste.

Here, I analyse my tracking data. Read my [blog](https://inside-numbers.com/six-things-i-learned-by-tracking-my-plastic-waste-everyday-in-2021) on the findings.
